Make edits to a new file (here were adding hi to the hi.txt file)   `touch hi.txt; echo \"hi\" > hi.txt` 2. Add files with changes to repo   `git add -A` to add all files    `git add hi.txt` for just that file 3. Commit changes and don't forget to include a note!    `git commit -m <message>`   `git commit -m \"Added new file\">` 4. Push to github (to finally add everything   `git push`",
